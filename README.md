## Text Classification

This project uses text from [Reddit.com] to develop classification models that can predict a topic in a binary choice. A pair of "subreddits" was chosen: AskScience (questions about science) and EatCheapAndHealthy (questions and suggestions about making and eating inexpensive and healthy food). The vocabulary of these two was, not surprisingly, generally different. In the second phase, the AskScience subreddit was compared to a more similar one: Ask Historians (moderated questions about history).
